  |   From the developers of the BIT.TRIP series comes Bubsy: Paws on       |
  |   Fire!, the latest and greatest in bobcat-based gaming.                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Oinker P. Hamm is determined to capture every animal in the           |
  |   universe for his "Amazootorium". Bubsy, fearing mostly for himself,   |
  |   is just as determined to stop him. Two archrivals, stitched           |
  |   together by the cruel knitting needles of fate. No matter who         |
  |   emerges victorious, there is one thing we know for certain: There's   |
  |   going to be a whole lot of yarn along the way.                        |
  |                                                                         |
